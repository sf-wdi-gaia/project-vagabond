## Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, codenamed Vagabond for now, for users to share tips (aka posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

## Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

* <a href="wireframes.png" target="_blank">Wireframes</a>
* <a href="userstories.md" target="_blank">User Stories</a>

## Expectations

This contract consists of four core sprints and four bonus sprints. Each sprint consists of a set of user stories. Most groups will not complete all of the sprints within the time period.  YOU MAY NOT BEGIN A NEW SPRINT OR START ON BONUSES WITHOUT CLIENT APPROVAL.

You need to be at GA every morning at **10am** to meet with your client.

You will work in groups of four, and we expect you to always **pair** when writing code.

During morning scrums and in smaller check-ins throughout the day, clearly communicate your current status and your next steps to your teammates. Use a kanban-style scrum board such as trello to organize tasks (<a href="https://trello.com/b/JPdt327u/vagabond" target="_blank">example trello board</a>).

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Consider creating automated tests or even implementing **TDD** for any significantly complex application behavior.

Put effort into your **design**. Use a CSS framework (Bootstrap), partials, and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

Use the git [Collaborator Scenario](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules-23/tree/master/w07-ruby-on-rails-cont/d3-homework#collaborator-scenario).

**Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

* Naming
* Commenting
* Organization
* DRYness
* Indentation
* Readability

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** Identify vague areas. Seek clarification in any cases where you feel less confident about your interpretation of the client' vision.

1. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

1. **Which models do need to be implemented?** Create an ERD for the client to reference.

1. **What are the major milestones or components that need to be completed?** How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs? Where do these milestones overlap and how those related tasks be managed?

1. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?

## Presentation

Each group will present their project on **Tuesday, November 17th** starting at **10:30am** for 10 minutes.

Each member of your group should speak during your presentation. Make sure to mention which parts of the project you worked on.

Make sure your presentation includes:

* Tour of your app
* What your group did that is unique or creative in approaching the requirements
* What was easier than you thought? What was more challenging?
* What is a lesson you will carry forward to the group project?
* Shout outs for fellow students
