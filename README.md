# Time Travelog



## Brief

The world is an interesting place...
And time!  Our app gives the discriminating Time Traveller a place to record the greatest moments through history in various places on Earth.  Ask not where, but when!!

## Project Planning

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

# Original Task

## Expectations


**IMPORTANT:** You may not begin a new sprint or start on a bonus without client approval.

**pair program**

communicate your current status 
Use **Trello** to organize 
Commit changes at least once for each user story. 
Consider creating **automated tests** or even implementing TDD for any complex application behavior.

**Design**. Use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap), partials, and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

Use the **[git collaborator scenario](./git-collaboration-workflow.md)</a>, feature branches, and pull requests**.

**Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

* Indentation
* Readability
* Naming
* Organization
* Commenting
* DRYness

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** 
2. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** 
3. **Which models do you need to implement?** Create an ERD
4. **What are the major milestones or components that you need to complete?** turned into tasks
Where do these milestones overlap and how will those related tasks be managed?
5. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** 
delegate the work so that each is interested, challenged, and productive?

* Tour (demo) of your app.
